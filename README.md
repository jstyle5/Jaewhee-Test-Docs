### How We Created Our Guide
At first, we chose our main topic, **KakaoTalk**, which is the most popular chat application in South Korea. We've been using this application since it was first released in the world. We use this application every day.

#### Using MarkDown
We are asked to use MarkDown in writing this document. Since we were all unfamiliar with it, we had to spend time learning how to use this amazing interface. MarkDown provides useful examples. Writing a document with this was such a great opportunity as future programmers. Thanks to Sam's video tutorials, we were able to fork the master repository of Just the Docs. By editing YAML files, we could lay out the basic shape of our document, and we began writing this guide.

#### Using Visual Studio Code & GitHub Desktop
Since Term 1 in CST, we are already familiar with using VSC and GitHub. After learning the basic concept of MarkDown and Just-The-Docs, applying them with our knowledge was not that difficult. Rather, it was a good opportunity to write a document with IDE.

---

### Conclusion
Generally, writing a document was such an excellent opportunity for us. Although we were a bit behind of our schedules, we would say that we learned a lot while writing this guide. We've never written documents through GitHub, and it was our first time to hear MarkDown and Just-The-Docs. However, we are excited to write documents using MarkDown and Just-The-Docs in the future!
